                        They rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far from easy.
                                                
                        ENFJs are born leaders, which explains why these personalities can be found among many notable politicians,

                        These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions that reflect their sense of hope and goodwill toward others.

                        ENFPs (ENFPs) are true free spirits – outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded. With their lively, upbeat approach to life,
                        they stand out in any crowd. But even though they can be the life of the party, ENFPs don’t just care about having a good time.
                        These personality types run deep – as does their longing for meaningful, emotional connections with other people.
                                                
                        Friendly and outgoing, ENFPs are devoted to enriching their relationships and their social lives. But beneath their sociable,
                        easygoing exteriors, they have rich, vibrant inner lives as well. Without a healthy dose of imagination, creativity, and curiosity,
                        a ENFP simply wouldn’t be a ENFP.
                                                
                        In their unique way, ENFPs can be quite introspective. They can’t help but ponder the deeper meaning and significance of life – even when
                        they should be paying attention to something else. These personalities believe that everything – and everyone – is connected, and they live
                        for the glimmers of insight that they can gain into these connections.
                                                
                        ENFPs are independent and creative, always on the lookout for the magic and meaning in everyday life.
                        When something sparks their imagination, ENFPs can show an enthusiasm that is nothing short of infectious.
                        These personalities radiate a positive energy that draws in other people, and ENFPs may find themselves being held
                        up by their peers as a leader or guru. But once the initial bloom of inspiration wears off, ENFPs can struggle with
                        self-discipline and consistency, losing steam on projects that once meant so much to them.
                                                
                        Seeking Joy
                        ENFPs are proof that seeking out life’s joys and pleasures isn’t the same as being shallow. Seemingly in the blink of an eye,
                        people with this personality type can transform from impassioned idealists to carefree figures on the dance floor.
                                                
                        ENFP personalities are capable of intense thought and feeling – and also of kicking back and having a good time.
                        Even in moments of fun, ENFPs want to connect emotionally with others. Few things matter more to these personality types
                        than having genuine, heartfelt conversations with the people they cherish. ENFPs believe that everyone deserves to express their feelings,
                        and their empathy and warmth create spaces where even the most timid spirits can feel comfortable opening up.""");

                        while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders.
                                                
                         ENTJs see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right, but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an elaborate
                         sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. People with the Commander personality type will root out such behavior wherever they go.
                        Energetic – Rather than finding this process taxing Commanders are energized by it, genuinely enjoying leading their teams forward as they implement their plans and goals.
                        ENTJ couldn’t do this if they were plagued by self-doubt – they trust their abilities, make known their opinions, and believe in their capacities as leaders.
                        Strong-Willed – Nor do they give up when the going gets tough – Commander personalities strive to achieve their goals, but really nothing is quite as
                        satisfying to them as rising to the challenge of each obstacle in their run to the finish line.
                        ENTJ exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan, and are known for examining
                        every angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole project forward with their solutions. These qualities combine to create
                        individuals who are able to inspire and invigorate others, who people actually want to be their leaders, and this in turn helps Commanders to accomplish their often
                        ambitious goals that could never be finished alone.

                        Quick-witted and audacious, ENTP aren’t afraid to disagree with the status quo. In fact, they’re not afraid to disagree with pretty much anything or anyone.
                        Few things light up people with this personality type more than a bit of verbal sparring – and if the conversation veers into controversial terrain, so much the better.
                                                
                        ENTP are known for their rebellious streak. For this personality type, no belief is too sacred to be questioned, no idea is too fundamental to be scrutinized,
                        and no rule is too important to be broken, or at least thoroughly tested. Sometimes ENTP even rebel against their own beliefs by arguing the opposing viewpoint – just to
                        see how the world looks from the other side.
                        some of the weakness of the ENTP are that they have mental exercise of debating and to them, nothing is sacred. They often misjudge others feelings and push their debtates well

                        An ISFP (ISFP) is a person with the Introverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life,
                        new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials.
                                                
                        I change during the course of a day. I wake and I’m one person, and when I go to sleep I know for certain I’m somebody else.

                        ISFPs are true artists – although not necessarily in the conventional sense. For this personality type, life itself is a canvas for self-expression.
                        From what they wear to how they spend their free time, ISFPs act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals.
                                                
                        And every ISFP is certainly unique. Driven by curiosity and eager to try new things, people with this personality often have a fascinating array of passions and interests.
                        With their exploratory spirits and their ability to find joy in everyday life, ISFPs can be among the most interesting people you’ll ever meet. The only irony? Unassuming and
                        humble, ISFPs tend to see themselves as “just doing their own thing,” so they may not even realize how remarkable they really are.
                                                
                                                
                        The Beauty of an Open Mind
                        ISFPs embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some personality types thrive on strict schedules and routines – but not ISFPs. ISFPs take each day as it comes, doing
                        what feels right to them in the moment. And they make sure to leave plenty of room in their lives for the unexpected – with the result that many of their most cherished memories
                        are of spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by themselves or with their loved ones.
                                                
                        This flexible mindset makes ISFPs remarkably tolerant and open-minded. These personalities genuinely love living in a world filled with all kinds of people – even people who disagree
                        with them or choose radically different lifestyles. It’s no surprise, then, that ISFPs are unusually open to changing their minds and rethinking their opinions. If any personality
                        type believes in giving something (or someone) a second chance, it’s ISFPs.
                                                
                        ISFPs want to live in a world where they – and everyone else – have the freedom to live as they see fit, without judgment.
                        That said, ISFPs’ go-with-the-flow mentality can have its downsides. People with this personality type may struggle to set long-term plans – let alone stick with them. As a result,
                        ISFPs tend to have a pretty cloudy view of their ability to achieve their goals, and they often worry about letting other people down. ISFPs may find that adding a little structure to
                        their lives goes a long way toward helping them feel more capable and organized – without quashing their independent spirits.
                                                
                        Living in Harmony
                        In their relationships, ISFPs are warm, friendly, and caring, taking wholehearted enjoyment in the company of their nearest and dearest. But make no mistake: this is an Introverted personality
                        type, meaning that ISFPs need dedicated alone time to recharge their energy after socializing with others. This alone time is what allows ISFPs to reestablish a sense of their own identity – in other
                        words, to reconnect with who they truly are.

                        ESTPs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings – the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move from group to group. Laughing
                        and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, ESTP personalities love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on stage, ESTPs volunteer – or volunteer a shy friend.
                                                
                        Theory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don’t keep ESTPs interested for long. ESTPs keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of
                        intelligence, but they like to talk about what is – or better yet, to just go out and do it. ESTPs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather than sitting idle, preparing
                        contingencies and escape clauses.
                                                
                                                
                        Diving Right In
                        ESTPs are the likeliest personality type to make a lifestyle of risky behavior. They live in the moment and dive into the action – they are the eye of the storm. People with the ESTP personality
                        type enjoy drama, passion, and pleasure, not for emotional thrills, but because it’s so stimulating to their logical minds. They are forced to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality
                        in a process of rapid-fire rational stimulus response.
                                                
                        This makes school and other highly organized environments a challenge for ESTPs. It certainly isn’t because they aren’t smart, and they can do well, but the regimented, lecturing approach of formal
                        education is just so far from the hands-on learning that ESTPs enjoy. It takes a great deal of maturity to see this process as a necessary means to an end, something that creates more exciting opportunities.
                                                
                        Also challenging is that to ESTPs, it makes more sense to use their own moral compass than someone else’s. Rules were made to be broken. This is a sentiment few high school instructors or corporate
                        supervisors are likely to share, and can earn ESTP personalities a certain reputation. But if they minimize the trouble-making, harness their energy, and focus through the boring stuff, ESTPs are a
                        force to be reckoned with.
                                                
                        The Path Less Traveled
                        With perhaps the most perceptive, unfiltered view of any type, ESTPs have a unique skill in noticing small changes. Whether a shift in facial expression, a new clothing style, or a broken habit, people
                        with this personality type pick up on hidden thoughts and motives where most types would be lucky to pick up anything specific at all. ESTPs use these observations immediately, calling out the change and
                        asking questions, often with little regard for sensitivity. ESTPs should remember that not everyone wants their secrets and decisions broadcast.""");

                        ESTJs are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty,
                        dedication and dignity, people with the ESTJ personality type are valued for their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way on difficult paths. Taking pride in bringing people together, ESTJs
                        often take on roles as community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together in celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of the traditional values that hold families and communities together.

                        Demand for such leadership is high in democratic societies, and forming no less than 11% of the population, it’s no wonder that many of America’s presidents have been ESTJs. Strong believers in the rule of law
                        and authority that must be earned, ESTJ personalities lead by example, demonstrating dedication and purposeful honesty, and an utter rejection of laziness and cheating, especially in work. If anyone declares
                        hard, manual work to be an excellent way to build character, it is ESTJs.
                                                
                        ESTJs are aware of their surroundings and live in a world of clear, verifiable facts – the surety of their knowledge means that even against heavy resistance, they stick to their principles and push an unclouded
                        vision of what is and is not acceptable. Their opinions aren’t just empty talk either, as ESTJs are more than willing to dive into the most challenging projects, improving action plans and sorting details along
                        the way, making even the most complicated tasks seem easy and approachable.
                                                
                        However, ESTJs don’t work alone, and they expect their reliability and work ethic to be reciprocated – people with this personality type meet their promises, and if partners or subordinates jeopardize them through
                        incompetence or laziness, or worse still, dishonesty, they do not hesitate to show their wrath. This can earn them a reputation for inflexibility, a trait shared by all Sentinel personalities, but it’s not because
                        ESTJs are arbitrarily stubborn, but because they truly believe that these values are what make society work.

                        ESTJs are classic images of the model citizen: they help their neighbors, uphold the law, and try to make sure that everyone participates in the communities and organizations they hold so dear.
                        The main challenge for ESTJs is to recognize that not everyone follows the same path or contributes in the same way. A true leader recognizes the strength of the individual, as well as that of the group,
                        and helps bring those individuals’ ideas to the table. That way, ESTJs really do have all the facts, and are able to lead the charge in directions that work for everyone.""");

                        This doesn’t mean that ESFJs like everyone, or that they’re saints. But ESFJs do believe in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of duty to those around them.

                        The Beauty of a Responsible Life
                        ESFJs are altruists. They take seriously their responsibilities to give back, serve others, and do the right thing.
                                                
                        And ESFJs believe that there is a clear right thing to do in nearly every situation. While some personality types adopt a more lenient, live-and-let-live attitude, ESFJs may find it difficult not
                        to judge when someone takes a path that strikes them as misguided. As a result, ESFJs often struggle to accept it when someone – particularly someone they care about – disagrees with them.
                                                
                        ESFJs have a clear moral compass – and it can be nothing short of baffling to them when other people’s actions don’t align with it.
                        With their definite views on right and wrong, ESFJs tend to be on the opinionated side. But these opinions aren’t arbitrary – they’re often based on a deep respect for tradition. ESFJs know that
                        everything they do affects someone else, and they trust that established laws, protocols, and social norms will help them navigate their everyday lives in a way that is considerate and responsible toward others.
                                                
                        Building Relationships That Last
                        Supportive and outgoing, ESFJs can always be spotted at a party – they’re the ones fluttering around making sure that everyone else is having a good time! But make no mistake: ESFJs don’t just breeze through
                        other people’s lives. Loyal to the core, they build lasting relationships, and they can be counted on to show up whenever a helping hand – or a listening ear – is needed.
                                                
                        ESFJs rarely miss a birthday or holiday. Devoted to their relationships, they commit even the smallest details of their friends’ and loved ones’ lives to memory.
                        With their love of order and structure, ESFJs prefer planned events to open-ended activities or spontaneous get-togethers – and they’re happy to host in order to ensure that everything goes smoothly.
                        People with this personality type put a great deal of energy into making other people feel special and celebrated, and they may take it personally when someone doesn’t seem to appreciate their efforts.
                                                
                        For many people with the ESFJ personality type, one of life’s greatest challenges is accepting that they can’t control anyone else’s thoughts or behavior – not even those who are nearest and dearest to them.

                        It’s not just talk either – ESFPs have the strongest aesthetic sense of any personality type. From grooming and outfits to a well-appointed home, ESFP personalities have an eye for fashion. Knowing what’s
                        attractive the moment they see it, ESFPs aren’t afraid to change their surroundings to reflect their personal style. ESFPs are naturally curious, exploring new designs and styles with ease.
                                                
                        Though it may not always seem like it, ESFPs know that it’s not all about them – they are observant, and very sensitive to others’ emotions. People with this personality type are often the first to help
                        someone talk out a challenging problem, happily providing emotional support and practical advice. However, if the problem is about them, ESFPs are more likely to avoid a conflict altogether than to address
                        it head-on. ESFPs usually love a little drama and passion, but not so much when they are the focus of the criticisms it can bring.
                                                
                        A Spontaneous Spirit
                        The biggest challenge ESFPs face is that they are often so focused on immediate pleasures that they neglect the duties and responsibilities that make those luxuries possible. Complex analysis, repetitive tasks,
                        and matching statistics to real consequences are not easy activities for ESFPs. They’d rather rely on luck or opportunity, or simply ask for help from their extensive circle of friends. It is important for ESFPs
                        to challenge themselves to keep track of long-term things like their retirement plans or sugar intake – there won’t always be someone else around who can help to keep an eye on these things.
                                                
                        ESFPs recognize value and quality, which on its own is a fine trait. In combination with their tendency to be poor planners though, this can cause them to live beyond their means, and credit cards are
                        especially dangerous. More focused on leaping at opportunities than in planning out long-term goals, ESFPs may find that their inattentiveness has made some activities unaffordable.
                                                
                        There’s nothing that makes ESFPs feel quite as unhappy as realizing that they are boxed in by circumstance, unable to join their friends.
                        ESFPs are welcome wherever there’s a need for laughter, playfulness, and a volunteer to try something new and fun – and there’s no greater joy for ESFP personalities than to bring everyone else along for
                        the ride. ESFPs can chat for hours, sometimes about anything but the topic they meant to talk about, and share their loved ones’ emotions through good times and bad. If they can just remember to keep their
                        ducks in a row, they’ll always be ready to dive into all the new and exciting things the world has to offer, friends in tow.""");

                         ISTP is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have an individualistic mindset, pursuing goals without needing much external connection.
                         They engage in life with inquisitiveness and personal skill, varying their approach as needed.
                                                
                        I wanted to live the life, a different life. I didn’t want to go to the same place every day and see the same people and do the same job. I wanted interesting challenges.
                                                
                        HARRISON FORD
                        ISTPs love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality type are natural Makers,
                        moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, ISTPs find no greater joy than
                        in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.
                                                
                                                
                        ISTPs explore ideas through creating, troubleshooting, trial and error and first-hand experience. They enjoy having other people take an interest in their projects and sometimes don’t even mind them
                        getting into their space. Of course, that’s on the condition that those people don’t interfere with ISTPs’ principles and freedom, and they’ll need to be open to ISTPs returning the interest in kind.
                                                
                        ISTPs enjoy lending a hand and sharing their experience, especially with the people they care about, and it’s a shame they’re so uncommon, making up only about five percent of the population. ISTP women
                        are especially rare, and the typical gender roles that society tends to expect can be a poor fit – they’ll often be seen as tomboys from a young age.
                                                
                        Dare to Differ
                        While their mechanical tendencies can make them appear simple at a glance, ISTPs are actually quite enigmatic. Friendly but very private, calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely curious but unable to
                        stay focused on formal studies, ISTP personalities can be a challenge to predict, even by their friends and loved ones. ISTPs can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but they tend to build up a store
                        of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions.
                                                
                        Rather than some sort of vision quest though, ISTPs are merely exploring the viability of a new interest when they make these seismic shifts.
                        ISTPs’ decisions stem from a sense of practical realism, and at their heart is a strong sense of direct fairness, a “do unto others” attitude, which really helps to explain many of ISTPs’ puzzling traits.
                        Instead of being overly cautious though, avoiding stepping on toes in order to avoid having their toes stepped on, ISTPs are likely to go too far, accepting likewise retaliation, good or bad, as fair play.
                                                
                        The biggest issue ISTPs are likely to face is that they often act too soon, taking for granted their permissive nature and assuming that others are the same. They’ll be the first to tell an insensitive joke,
                        get overly involved in someone else’s project, roughhouse and play around, or suddenly change their plans because something more interesting came up.
                                                
                        Defying the Rules
                        ISTPs will come to learn that many other personality types have much more firmly drawn lines on rules and acceptable behavior than they do – they don’t want to hear an insensitive joke, and certainly
                        wouldn’t tell one back, and they wouldn’t want to engage in horseplay, even with a willing party. If a situation is already emotionally charged, violating these boundaries can backfire tremendously.
                                                
                        ISTPs have a particular difficulty in predicting emotions, but this is just a natural extension of their fairness, given how difficult it is to gauge ISTPs’ emotions and motivations. However, their tendency
                        to explore their relationships through their actions rather than through empathy can lead to some very frustrating situations. People with the ISTP personality type struggle with boundaries and guidelines,
                        preferring the freedom to move about and color outside the lines if they need to.
                                                
                        Finding an environment where they can work with good friends who understand their style and unpredictability, combining their creativity, sense of humor and hands-on approach to build practical solutions and things,
                        will give ISTPs many happy years of building useful boxes – and admiring them from the outside.""");

                        A Logistician (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet willful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their
                        actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose.
                                                
                        ISTJ pride themselves on their integrity. People with this personality type mean what they say, and when they commit to doing something, they make sure to follow through.
                                                
                        This personality type makes up a good portion of the overall population, and while ISTJ may not be particularly flashy or attention-seeking, they do more than their share to keep society on a sturdy,
                        stable foundation. In their families and their communities, ISTJ often earn respect for their reliability, their practicality, and their ability to stay grounded and logical, even in the most stressful situations.
                                                
                        The core of ISTJ’ self-respect comes from a sense of personal integrity. People with this personality type believe that there is a right way to proceed in any situation – and that anyone who pretends otherwise
                        is probably trying to bend the rules to suit their own purposes. ISTJ have a deep respect for structure and tradition, and they are often drawn to organizations, workplaces, and educational settings that offer
                        clear hierarchies and expectations.
                                                
                        For many ISTJ, a lack of structure offers not freedom, but chaos.
                        People with the Logistician personality type rarely hesitate to take responsibility for their actions and choices. Generally speaking, they are quick to own up to their own mistakes, admitting the truth even
                        if it doesn’t make them look good. To ISTJ, honesty is far more important than showmanship, and they’d rather satisfy their own conscience than lie to impress someone else.
                                                
                        ISTJ’ dedication is an admirable quality, and it drives many of their accomplishments. But it can also become a weakness that other people take advantage of. With their strong work ethic and sense of duty, ISTJ
                        may routinely find themselves shouldering other people’s responsibilities. Even if they don’t complain about the situation, ISTJ can end up exhausted or discouraged if they’re constantly expected – or taking it
                        upon themselves – to pick up the slack for their colleagues, friends, or loved ones.""");

                        In their unassuming, understated way, ISFJs help make the world go round. Hardworking and devoted, people with this personality type feel a deep sense of responsibility to those around them. ISFJs can be
                        counted on to meet deadlines, remember birthdays and special occasions, uphold traditions, and shower their loved ones with gestures of care and support. But they rarely demand recognition for all that they
                        do, preferring instead to operate behind the scenes.
                                                
                        This is a capable, can-do personality type, with a wealth of versatile gifts. Though sensitive and caring, ISFJs also have excellent analytical abilities and an eye for detail. And despite their reserve,
                        they tend to have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships. ISFJs are truly more than the sum of their parts, and their varied strengths shine in even the most ordinary aspects of their
                        daily lives.

                        The Gift of Loyalty
                        Among ISFJs’ most distinctive traits is loyalty. Rare is the ISFJ who allows a friendship or relationship to fade away from lack of effort. Instead, they invest a great deal of energy into maintaining
                        strong connections with their loved ones – and not just by sending “How are you doing?” texts. People with this personality type are known for dropping everything and lending a hand whenever a friend or family
                        member is going through a hard time.
                                                
                        ISFJs tend to feel most energized and effective when they’re showing up for someone who needs their help.
                        ISFJs’ sense of loyalty doesn’t stop with their nearest and dearest – it often extends to their communities, their employers, and even family traditions. But the intensity of their commitment and desire to
                        serve can have its downsides. Other people may take advantage of ISFJs’ helpful, hardworking nature, leaving them feeling burned out and overworked. And ISFJs may feel guilty or stressed when they contemplate
                        changes – even necessary changes – to themselves, their relationships, or the way they’ve done things in the past.
                                                
                        The Highest of Standards
                        For ISFJs, “good enough” is rarely good enough. People with this personality type can be meticulous to the point of perfectionism. They take their responsibilities personally, consistently going above and beyond
                        and doing everything that they can to exceed others’ expectations.
                                                
                        ISFJ personalities are known for their humility, and they rarely seek the spotlight.
                        But what happens when ISFJs’ efforts go unnoticed or unappreciated? While ISFJs tend to underplay their accomplishments, that doesn’t mean that they don’t enjoy recognition – or that they’re fine with being taken
                        for granted. Unless they learn to stand up for themselves, ISFJs may find themselves quietly losing their enthusiasm and motivation, eventually becoming resentful toward the people who just don’t seem to appreciate
                        them.
                                                
                        Showing Up for Others – and Themselves
                        Although they’re Introverted, ISFJs have a deeply social nature. Thanks to their ability to remember the details of other people’s lives, ISFJs have a special talent for making their friends and acquaintances feel
                        seen, known, and cherished. Few personality types can match ISFJs’ ability to choose just the right gift for any occasion, whether large or small.
                                                
                        Dedicated and thoughtful, ISFJs find great joy in helping those around them build stable, secure, and happy lives. It may not be easy for people with this personality type to show up for themselves in the way that
                        they show up for other people, but when they do, they often find themselves with even more energy and motivation to do good in the world.""");

                        A  (INFP) is someone who possesses the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and they apply a
                        caring and creative approach to everything they do.
                                                
                        Although they may seem quiet or unassuming,  (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and
                        conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity – INFP can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.
                                                
                        Idealistic and empathetic, INFP long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. But because this personality type makes up such a small portion of the population,
                        INFPs may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique.
                                                
                        Empathy is among this personality type’s greatest gifts, but at times it can be a liability. The troubles of the world weigh heavily on INFP’ shoulders, and these personalities can be vulnerable
                        to internalizing other people’s negative moods or mindsets. Unless they learn to set boundaries, INFP may feel overwhelmed by just how many wrongs there are that need to be set right.
                                                
                        People with this personality type tend to feel directionless or stuck until they connect with a sense of purpose for their lives. For many INFP, this purpose has something to do with uplifting others
                        and their ability to feel other people’s suffering as if it were their own. While INFP want to help everyone, they need to focus their energy and efforts – otherwise, they can end up exhausted.""");

                        An Advocate (INFJ) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision,
                        personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.
                                                
                        “Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being.”
                                                
                        (INFJs) may be the rarest personality type of all, but they certainly leave their mark on the world. Idealistic and principled, they aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up
                        and make a difference. For Advocate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world.
                                                
                        While they have lofty goals and ambitions, INFJs shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until they’ve done
                        what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life with a clear sense of their values, and they aim never to lose sight of what truly matters – not according to other
                        people or society at large, but according to their own wisdom and intuition.
                                                
                        Perhaps because their personality type is so uncommon, INFJs tend to carry around a sense – whether conscious or not – of being different from most people. With their rich inner lives and their deep,
                        abiding desire to find their life purpose, they don’t always fit in with those around them. This isn’t to say that Advocates can’t enjoy social acceptance or close relationships – only that they sometimes
                        feel misunderstood or at odds with the world.
                                                
                        INFJ may be Introverted, but they value deep, authentic relationships with others. Few things bring these personalities as much joy as truly knowing another person – and being known in return. Advocates
                        enjoy meaningful conversations far more than small talk, and they tend to communicate in a way that is warm and sensitive""");
